xdc-nodejs-pool
======================

High performance Node.js (with native C addons) mining pool.

Features
===

#### Optimized pool server
* TCP (stratum-like) protocol for server-push based jobs
  * Compared to old HTTP protocol, this has a higher hash rate, lower network/CPU server load, lower orphan
    block percent, and less error prone
* Support for Cryptonight Original, Cryptonight Light and Cryptonight Heavy algorithms.
* IP banning to prevent low-diff share attacks
* Socket flooding detection
* Share trust algorithm to reduce share validation hashing CPU load
* Clustering for vertical scaling
* Ability to configure multiple ports - each with their own difficulty
* Miner login (wallet address) validation
* Workers identification (specify worker name as the password)
* Variable difficulty / share limiter
* Set fixed difficulty on miner client by passing "address" param with "+[difficulty]" postfix
* Modular components for horizontal scaling (pool server, database, stats/API, payment processing, front-end)
* SSL support for both pool and API servers
* RBPPS (PROP) payment system

#### Live statistics API
* Currency network/block difficulty
* Current block height
* Network hashrate
* Pool hashrate
* Each miners' individual stats (hashrate, shares submitted, pending balance, total paid, payout estimate, etc)
* Blocks found (pending, confirmed, and orphaned)
* Historic charts of pool's hashrate, miners count and coin difficulty
* Historic charts of users's hashrate and payments

#### Mined blocks explorer
* Mined blocks table with block status (pending, confirmed, and orphaned)
* Blocks luck (shares/difficulty) statistics
* Universal blocks and transactions explorer based on [chainradar.com](http://chainradar.com)

#### Smart payment processing
* Splintered transactions to deal with max transaction size
* Minimum payment threshold before balance will be paid out
* Minimum denomination for truncating payment amount precision to reduce size/complexity of block transactions
* Prevent "transaction is too big" error with "payments.maxTransactionAmount" option
* Option to enable dynamic transfer fee based on number of payees per transaction and option to have miner pay transfer fee instead of pool owner (applied to dynamic fee only)
* Control transactions priority with config.payments.priority (default: 0).
* Set payment ID on miner client when using "[address].[paymentID]" login
* Integrated payment ID addresses support for Exchanges

#### Admin panel
* Aggregated pool statistics
* Coin daemon & wallet RPC services stability monitoring
* Log files data access
* Users list with detailed statistics

#### Pool stability monitoring
* Detailed logging in process console & log files
* Coin daemon & wallet RPC services stability monitoring
* See logs data from admin panel

#### Extra features
* An easily extendable, responsive, light-weight front-end using API to display data
* Onishin's [keepalive function](https://github.com/perl5577/cpuminer-multi/commit/0c8aedb)
* Support for slush mining system (disabled by default)
* E-Mail Notifications on worker connected, disconnected (timeout) or banned (support MailGun, SMTP and Sendmail)
* Telegram channel notifications when a block is unlocked
* Top 10 miners report
* Multilingual user interface
